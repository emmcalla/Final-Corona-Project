# Final-Corona-Project Adam Stevens, Ben Stevens, Sunny Patel. 2020.
Final Game Jam>Team Jame Gam>Corona theme game.
This is our text adventure game we created using the corona theme. The goal of the game is to get your essentials and checkout without getting the virus. There is a decision you make at each step and the correct one leads you on in the story and the wrong one is a game over. It is a 12 step game where Ben did 4 steps of code Adam did 4 steps of code and Sunny did 4 steps of code. We all made the story together.
